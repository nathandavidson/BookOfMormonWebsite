                        <p>The Book of Mormon has a lot of people in it. Like, a lot. So far removed from where we live today, it's easy as an observer to view the Book of Mormon peoples as fundamentally different than us, this distant blessed in-group endowed with a natural spiritual capacity that those darn Lamanites just didn't have (so we say at least...). In other words, it's easy to say, "that Laman and Lemuel! How blind are they? Isn't it obvious they are in the wrong? How many angels do they need to see?" And yet, we forget, even in the very act of criticizing, that we've already offered 8 prayers this morning asking for a divine confirmation that our summer plans line up with the Lord's summer plans for us (when we know perfectly well we can't afford that expensive vacation we had planned).</p>
                        <p>Don't get me wrong, praying is always good and so are vacations, but even better is to trust in the Lord at the very first answer we receive. If we know it's not right we shouldn't do it. But we've all been there. Just this week I asked the Lord in prayer this one question every single day, and today I know the answer is the exact same as it was 7 days ago. But really, that's not even my point. What I'm getting at here is that You and I today, are no different than the ancient Book of Mormoners of Alma and Amulek's day.</p>
                        <p>One of the most striking similarities between the people of the Book of Mormon and everyone who has ever lived, including Latter-Day-Saints, is this discouragemet that won't seem to leave the human race alone. As Saints of the restoration we hopefully recognize the source of true relief from discouragement. Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>I love the command: "Lift up your heads forever."</p>
                        <p>For those who have ever suffered from serious discouragement, the idea of a life without such is tauntingly hopeful. But it is possible and only possible by the One who knew all discouragement all too well.</p>
                        <p>Christ is that one. The Lord's literal extension of Mercy towards his Justice bound children, subject to laws, trials and temptations we cannot abide alone, Christ is the solution to discouragement.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Mercy and Justice</h2>
                        <p>Now, I’d like to briefly point out here that my purpose in creating this site is not necessarily to explain each and every spiritual insight I’ve had studying the Book of Mormon; rather, I intend to provide some interesting resources which I have found beneficial in my study. I’m doing this in hopes of creating both an external reference source which I can later reference back to, and an opportunity for others to see these resources and thereby enhance their own study of The Book of Mormon. I’m a firm believer, as I’ve said elsewhere, in the commentary Christ provides on his commandments: “Not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal.” I believe God inspires prophets as well as poets, artists as much as apostles, and the “sciency”as he does sacred. Do not misunderstand, Prophets are divinely ordained to receive revelation for the church poets, not necessarily so. I merely mean to say that what we deem purely “temporal” may be more spiritual in nature than we realize and we ought to search out of the best books (and songs and art and teachings) words of wisdom.</p>
                        <p>That being said here’s my two cents on Justice and Mercy: </p>
                        <p>Because the Law of Justice prohibits entry of unclean things into the God’s kingdom we must be made clean and can only be so through the merciful atonement of Jesus Christ who satisfies the demands of Justice on our behalf.</p>
                        <p>Just today, I came across a story by C.S. Lewis - <a class="italic" href="https://www.exodusbooks.com/Samples/Eerdmans/2920TOC.pdf" target="_blank">The Pilgrim's Regress</a> which I think gives great imagery of what it would feel like to be a creature subject to only Justice without the extension of much mercy.</p>
                        <p>Here’s my quick notes I took after reading:</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"CS Lewis: Book 1 (The Data) Chapter 1 (The Rules), The Data - John meets the steward and learns of the landlord. The steward of John’s Puritania paints the landlord as a legalistic being with a set of impossible rules to follow.</blockquote>
                        <p>Notice, the Steward John meets (though perhaps he really represents a pastor figure), paints the Landlord as kind and merciful, yet rigidly legalistic in upholding his laws. What confusion this creates for John. It can be confusing to read the laws detailed in scripture and attempt to reconcile that rigor with a loving merciful God without understanding the mode by which God extends Mercy: Christ (John 3:16-17).</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">"Whoso Shall Lose His Life"</h2>
                        <p>Naturally Christ, as our redeemer, is the very expression of God's love to us. When people talk about how hard it is to imagine a loving God allow us to go through hard things our response ought to center around Jesus Christ. Through him we understand that the Lord's mercy is not found in shielding us from difficult trials, but rather, he shows his love to us by helping us do hard things as beat them as a conqueror. The way he has prepared for us to do this is by becoming a disciple of Jesus Christ. Through him difficult concepts like mercy and justice are reconciled. Indeed. He is the reconciler. The redeemer. </p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                        <p>We are commanded to lose our life in the service of others.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."</blockquote>
                        <p>I came across this quote by T.S. Eliot which puts this thought equally poetically and perhaps leads us to ponder what it really means to lose one's life.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Where is the life we have lost in living<br>
                            Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?<br>
                            Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?</blockquote>
